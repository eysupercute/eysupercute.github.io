            Jay Chou (traditional Chinese: 周杰倫; simplified Chinese: 周杰伦; born January 18, 1979)[1] is a Taiwanese
            singer, songwriter, record producer, rapper, actor, and television personality. Dubbed the &#34;King of
            Mandopop&#34;, and having sold over 30 million records, Chou is one of the best-selling artists in Taiwan
            and is known for his work with lyricist Vincent Fang, with whom he has frequently collaborated on his
            music.[2] In 2000, Chou released his debut studio album, Jay (2000), under the record company EMI. Chou rose
            to fame with the release of his second studio album, Fantasy (范特西) (2001), which combined Western and
            Eastern music styles. The album won five Golden Melody Awards, including Album of the Year. He has since
            further released twelve more studio albums, spawning a string of hit singles and gaining significant
            prominence in Asian communities such as Taiwan, Hong Kong SAR, China Mainland, Malaysia, and Singapore. Chou
            has embarked on six world tours, performing in cities around the world to more than 10 million spectators as
            of 2019.[3] In 2012, Chou established his own record and management company Universal Music Group.[4]
            Outside of music, Chou has served as the President of his own fashion brand PHANTACi since 2006. As an
            actor, Chou made his acting debut in the film Initial D 頭文字D(2005), followed shortly by a starring role
            in the epic Curse of the Golden Flower (2006). He has since starred in a number of movies, becoming known to
            Western audiences when he made his Hollywood debut in 2011 with The Green Hornet, starring alongside Seth
            Rogen and Christoph Waltz, followed by Now You See Me 2 (2016).[5]
