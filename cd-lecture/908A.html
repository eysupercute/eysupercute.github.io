                    At Parsons' Communication Design program, E Roon Kang and Andrew LeClair from 908A presented a fascinating book called "1, 10, 100." The team's approach to creating the book was very interesting because they transformed student thesis work, which was originally in a database and written in HTML/CSS, into a printed publication that looked really nice. Instead of using the traditional way of creating a website, they chose to use a Content Management System (CMS) to create a book. They explained in detail the complex process, using different software programs to convert and adjust data and information to make it compatible with various mediums. It's worth mentioning that 908A created a specific submission form that enables students to write straight to the database, making the entire process more efficient.

                    The team used Prince HML to turn the book's HTML/CSS content into a PDF format that looks really good. This made the book come to life in its physical form. This tool is really versatile because it can convert things and has extra layout features. It's like a good replacement for Adobe InDesign. I found it fascinating how the book's visual design was inspired by CSS. One of the chapters had oval outlines around the text, which was a clear example of this. The design elements that look good were made by the computer when the HTML/CSS was turned into a PDF. This means that no one had to do the design work themselves in InDesign. Also, I really liked how careful they were when making the printed copies. They used different types of paper to tell apart student assignments from other materials. Additionally, they added embossed designs on the cover page to make it look more sophisticated and enhance the overall appearance.                </p>

                    As I looked at the books given to the 2021 and 2022 groups, I realized how important it is to have a methodical way of creating future versions. For "Framework 101," we used the same system as "1, 10, 100," but with some changes in color and shape. By maintaining deliberate consistency throughout the series, a cohesive collection of annual catalogues was created, which strengthened the overall design framework. Overall, the process of making "1, 10, 100" was really interesting. It showed how different software programs and formats can be used together to make a final product that combines digital and print mediums.
